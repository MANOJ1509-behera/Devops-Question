1. How does VPC peering work?
 VPC peering connects two VPCs for communication using private IPs. Traffic stays within AWS without transiting the internet.

2. What are route tables, and why are they important?
 Route tables define paths for traffic within a VPC and to external destinations (e.g., IGW, NAT).

3. Internet Gateway vs. NAT Gateway: 
 - IGW: Enables internet access for public subnet instances. 
 - NAT Gateway: Provides outbound internet access for private subnet instances.

4. Purpose of Security Groups and NACLs: 
 - Security Groups: Instance-level rules for inbound/outbound traffic. 
 - NACLs: Subnet-level, stateless rules for traffic filtering.

5. Restricting traffic between subnets: 
 Use NACLs or security group rules to limit access based on IP ranges or ports.

6. Designing a multi-region VPC architecture: 
 - Use Transit Gateway or VPC peering for inter-region connectivity. 
 - Ensure redundancy, low latency, and compliance with regulations.

7. AWS Transit Gateway vs. VPC Peering: 
 - Transit Gateway: Central hub for connecting multiple VPCs and on-prem networks. 
 - VPC Peering: One-to-one connection between VPCs.

8. Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) with VPC:
 Distributes incoming traffic across instances in subnets and enhances scalability and fault tolerance.

9. Ensuring high availability in a VPC design: 
 - Deploy resources across multiple Availability Zones. 
 - Use redundant IGWs, NAT Gateways, and load balancers.

10. VPC limits: 
 Default limits: 5 VPCs per region, 200 subnets per VPC. Limits can be increased via AWS Support.
