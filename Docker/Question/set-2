```
1. What were your biggest challenges while implementing Docker in your project? How did you overcome them?
2. Describe when using Docker saved significant time or resources in your project.
3. Imagine a containerized application failing to start due to missing dependencies. How would you debug this issue?
4. You need to migrate a Dockerized application to a new environment (e.g., from on-premises to the cloud). How would you approach this migration?
5. How would you optimize the build time of a Docker image in a CI/CD pipeline?
6. Your production environment uses multiple containers to handle high traffic. Suddenly, some containers become unresponsive. How do you troubleshoot this?
7. A containerized service is consuming excessive resources, impacting other services. How do you limit its resource usage using Docker?
8. Describe your approach to monitoring and logging in a Dockerized environment.
Follow-up: Did you integrate any tools like ELK Stack or Prometheus for monitoring containers?
9. Have you worked with multi-stage builds in Docker?
Follow-up: How did multi-stage builds improve the efficiency of your Docker images?
10. How do you secure sensitive information (e.g., API keys, database credentials) in Dockerized applications?
Follow-up: Did you use Docker Secrets or any external tools? How effective were they?
11. Explain how Docker Compose helped in orchestrating your multi-container application.
Follow-up: How did you ensure service dependencies (e.g., database availability) were correctly handled?
12. Have you faced any networking issues between containers in your project? How did you troubleshoot and resolve them?
13. Can you explain the difference between a Docker Volume and a bind mount?
Follow-up: In your project, which one did you prefer, and why?
14. How do you handle dependencies in a Docker container?
Follow-up: Have you encountered dependency conflicts while building Docker images? How did you resolve them?
15. How does Docker differ from traditional virtualization technologies like VMs?
Follow-up: What specific advantages did you observe when migrating your project from a VM-based architecture to Docker?
