1. Check the current system load and CPU usage in Linux:
Use uptime, top, or htop to check system load and CPU usage.

2. Purpose of the top and htop commands:
Both are used to monitor system processes and resource usage. htop is a more user-friendly, interactive version of top.

3. Check memory usage on your Linux system:
Use free -h or top to view memory usage.

4. Write a shell script to back up files:
1. Example script: 
	#!/bin/bash
	cp -r /path/to/source/* /path/to/destination/

5. Purpose of the #!/bin/bash line at the beginning of a script:
This is called a shebang, indicating the script should be executed using the Bash shell.

6. Create variables in a shell script:
To create a variable, simply assign a value: variable_name="value". Refer to it as $variable_name.

7. Difference between apt-get, yum, and dnf:
	apt-get: Package manager for Debian-based systems.
	yum: Package manager for older RedHat-based systems.
	dnf: The newer package manager for RedHat-based systems, replacing yum.

8. Install a package in a Debian-based system and in a RedHat-based system:
Debian: sudo apt-get install package-name
RedHat: sudo yum install package-name or sudo dnf install package-name

9. Update all packages on a Linux system:
Debian: sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade
RedHat: sudo yum update or sudo dnf update

10. Different types of file permissions in Linux:
Read (r): Permission to view the file content.
Write (w): Permission to modify the file.
Execute (x): Permission to execute the file.

11. Change the owner and group of a file in Linux:
Use chown owner:group file to change the file's owner and group.

12. Secure SSH connections in Linux:
Use SSH key-based authentication, disable root login, and use a strong passphrase.

13. Where are system logs stored in Linux:
Logs are stored in the /var/log/ directory, with files like /var/log/syslog, /var/log/auth.log, etc.

14. View logs in real-time:
Use tail -f /var/log/syslog to view logs as they are written.

15. Search for a specific event in system logs:
Use grep to search, for example: grep "event" /var/log/syslog to search for the event in syslog.
