2. How do you troubleshoot a system that is running out of memory?

Commands: free -m, top, vmstat, dmesg | grep -i oom

Explanation: Check memory usage with free and top.

Use vmstat to analyze memory statistics and look for OOM (Out of Memory) errors in dmesg.

4. The system is experiencing disk I/O issues. How would you troubleshoot?

Commands: iostat, iotop, dstat, vmstat

iotop shows I/O usage by processes. dstat provides detailed performance metrics for various resources.

5. How do you check for a full filesystem and resolve it?

Commands: df -h, du -sh *, Isof | grep deleted,

journalctl

Explanation: Use df to check filesystem usage, du to analyze space consumption by directories, and Isof to detect open but deleted files.

6. The system is not resolving domain names. How would you troubleshoot DNS issues?

Commands: nslookup, dig, cat /etc/resolv.conf, systemctl restart network
