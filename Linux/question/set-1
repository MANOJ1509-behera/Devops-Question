1. How would you diagnose and resolve a system that is running low on disk space?

Commands: df -h, du -sh *, Isof | grep deleted

Explanation: Use df to check disk usage, du to check directory sizes, and Isof to find open files that are consuming space.

2. How do you troubleshoot a system that is running out of memory?

Commands: free -m, top, vmstat, dmesg | grep -i oom

Explanation: Check memory usage with free and top.

Use vmstat to analyze memory statistics and look for OOM (Out of Memory) errors in dmesg.

3. The system is slow and users are complaining about performance. What steps would you take to troubleshoot?

Commands: top, htop, iotop, vmstat, sar

Explanation: Check CPU, memory, disk, and I/O usage with top and iotop. Use vmstat and sar for historical data analysis.

4. The system is experiencing disk I/O issues. How would you troubleshoot?

Commands: iostat, iotop, dstat, vmstat

Explanation: Use iostat to monitor disk I/O statistics.

iotop shows I/O usage by processes. dstat provides detailed performance metrics for various resources.

5. How do you check for a full filesystem and resolve it?

Commands: df -h, du -sh *, Isof | grep deleted,

journalctl

Explanation: Use df to check filesystem usage, du to analyze space consumption by directories, and Isof to detect open but deleted files.

6. The system is not resolving domain names. How would you troubleshoot DNS issues?

Commands: nslookup, dig, cat /etc/resolv.conf, systemctl restart network

Explanation: Use nslookup and dig to check DNS resolution. Verify /etc/resolv.conf for correct nameservers. Restart networking if necessary.

7. A critical Linux process died out of no where!
Has this ever happened to you?

As a DevOps engineer, I've dealt with this exact scenario in test/production environments. 

When it happens, you need to diagnose and resolve the issue ASAP. 

Here's how I investigate these issues:

✅Step 1: Check if the process is still running
-> ps aux | grep process_name to see if it crashed
-> pgrep -fl process_name to double-check if it's in memory
-> dmesg -T | tail -50 to look for segfaults or OOM kills

✅Step 2: Scan system logs for clues
-> journalctl -xe --no-pager -n 50 for errors before the process stopped
-> tail -f /var/log/syslog for warnings or crash messages

✅Step 3: Analyze CPU & memory usage
-> top -o %CPU to check for high CPU consumption
-> top -o %MEM to see if it hit memory limits
-> dmesg | grep -i "oom" to determine if the OOM Killer terminated it

✅ Step 4: Investigate disk issues
-> df -h to check if the disk is full and preventing writes
-> iostat -xm 1 to look for disk I/O bottlenecks that could've frozen the process
-> dmesg | grep -i "error" to find any file system errors

✅Step 5: Look for locked or deleted files
-> lsof -p <PID> to see if the process is stuck on a locked file
-> lsof | grep -iE "deleted|locked" to detect lingering file issues

✅Step 6: Determine if an external source killed the process
-> journalctl -u process_name --no-pager -n 50 to check for manual kills
-> lastcomm | grep process_name to find out who/what sent the kill signal

✅Step 7: Debug in real-time
-> strace -p <PID> to see what syscalls the process is making
-> gdb -p <PID> to attach and inspect the process state




11. Scenario: Slow System Performance
Users report the system is running slow. How do you diagnose the issue?
Check CPU and memory usage: top or htop
Identify disk bottlenecks: iostat -x 1 or iotop
Check running processes: ps aux --sort=-%mem | head
Monitor system load: uptime

12. Scenario: NFS Mount Not Working
A user cannot access an NFS-mounted directory. How do you troubleshoot?
Check NFS status: systemctl status nfs-server
Verify exports: exportfs -v
Test mount: showmount -e <server-ip>
Restart NFS service: systemctl restart nfs-server

13. Scenario: Corrupted Filesystem
A filesystem is showing errors. How do you repair it?
Check filesystem: fsck -y /dev/sdX (unmount first)
Remount the partition: mount -a
Monitor logs: dmesg | tail -20

14. Scenario: User Locked Out After Failed Login Attempts
A user is locked out after too many failed login attempts. How do you unlock them?
Check login failures: faillog -u <username>
Reset failed attempts: faillog -r -u <username>
If using pam_tally2: pam_tally2 --user <username> --reset

15. Scenario: Adding a New Disk to LVM
You added a new disk and need to extend an LVM volume. What steps do you take?
Identify the new disk: lsblk
Create a physical volume: pvcreate /dev/sdX
Extend the volume group: vgextend <vg_name> /dev/sdX
Extend the logical volume: lvextend -l +100%FREE /dev/<vg_name>/<lv_name>
Resize filesystem: resize2fs /dev/<vg_name>/<lv_name>

16. Scenario: Permission Denied on a Shared Directory
A user cannot write to a shared directory despite having write permissions. What could be the issue?
Check ownership: ls -ld /shared_dir
Verify group permissions: chmod g+w /shared_dir
Ensure the user is in the group: usermod -aG <group> <username>
If using ACLs, check with: getfacl /shared_dir

17. Scenario: Kernel Module Not Loading
You need to load a kernel module, but it fails. How do you fix it?
Check if the module exists: lsmod | grep <module>
Load it manually: modprobe <module>
If missing, install kernel-devel: dnf install kernel-devel
Enable it at boot: echo "<module>" >> /etc/modules-load.d/custom.conf

18. Scenario: Process Running on a Specific Port
How do you find which process is using port 8080?
netstat -tulnp | grep 8080
ss -tulnp | grep 8080
lsof -i :8080

19. Scenario: Configuring Automatic System Updates
How do you configure automatic security updates in RHEL 9?
Install dnf-automatic: dnf install dnf-automatic
Enable automatic updates: systemctl enable --now dnf-automatic.timer
Edit config: /etc/dnf/automatic.conf (apply_updates = yes)

20. Scenario: SSH Brute-Force Attacks
How do you protect an RHEL 9 server from SSH brute-force attacks?
Use fail2ban:
Install: dnf install fail2ban
Enable: systemctl enable --now fail2ban
Change SSH port: Edit /etc/ssh/sshd_config → Port 2222
Disable root login: PermitRootLogin no
Use key-based authentication instead of passwords
