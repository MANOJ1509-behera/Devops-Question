## set - 2

```
1. In a cluster with two nodes, one with pods and the other without, which node will a new pod be scheduled to?

2. If an application running in a container encounters an OOM (Out-of-Memory) error, will the container restart, or will the entire Pod be recreated?

3. Can application configurations such as environment variables or ConfigMap updates be applied dynamically without recreating the Pod?

4. Is a Pod stable once created, even if the user takes no further action?

5. Can a Service of type ClusterIP ensure load balancing for TCP traffic?

6. How should application logs be collected, and is there a risk of losing logs?

7. If an HTTP Server Pod’s liveness probe is functioning correctly, does it mean the application is problem-free?

8. How can an application scale to handle traffic fluctuations?

9. When you execute 𝘬𝘶𝘣𝘦𝘤𝘵𝘭 𝘦𝘹𝘦𝘤 -𝘪𝘵 <𝘱𝘰𝘥> -- 𝘣𝘢𝘴𝘩, are you logging into the pod?

10. How would you troubleshoot if a container in a Pod repeatedly exits and restarts?
