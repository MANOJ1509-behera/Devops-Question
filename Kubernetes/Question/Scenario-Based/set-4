```

1. Your application is set up with a Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA), but scaling is not happening even under high load. How would you troubleshoot why the HPA is not scaling the pods?What are the prerequisites for HPA to function properly?

2. You are deploying a stateful application, such as a database, on Kubernetes.
What are the key differences between StatefulSets and Deployments, and why would you choose one over the other?How do you handle scaling and backups for stateful workloads?

3. Your clusterâ€™s API server is responding slowly, impacting other components.
How would you diagnose and resolve API server performance bottlenecks?
What are the common causes of high API server latency?

4. A pod is stuck waiting for its Persistent Volume Claim (PVC) to be bound.
How do you debug and resolve PVC binding issues?What are the key considerations when provisioning storage dynamically in Kubernetes?

5. You need to configure a Kubernetes cluster for multi-tenancy to isolate workloads from different teams. How would you implement multi-tenancy in Kubernetes?What tools or features would you use to enforce resource isolation and security?

6. Your application pods are taking too long to start.
What could be causing the slow startup, and how would you debug the issue?
How do liveness and readiness probes impact pod startup?

7. Pods in your cluster are unable to resolve external domain names.
How would you debug and resolve DNS resolution failures in Kubernetes?
What are the key components involved in DNS resolution in a Kubernetes cluster?

8. A namespace in your cluster has reached its resource quota, and new pods canâ€™t be scheduled. How would you diagnose and resolve the issue?
What strategies can you implement to avoid such resource exhaustion in the future? Would you like to answer any specific scenario from this list? I can then review your approach and guide you further! ðŸš€

9. Your security team mandates that only images from a trusted private registry can be used in your Kubernetes cluster. How would you enforce this policy in your cluster? What Kubernetes features or tools can be used to achieve this?

10. Your team decides to implement a service mesh for better observability, security, and traffic control between microservices. How would you introduce a service mesh like Istio or Linkerd into your Kubernetes environment? What challenges would you expect during implementation, and how would you address them?

please don't be selfish...like , comments and repost... this might helpfull for other
