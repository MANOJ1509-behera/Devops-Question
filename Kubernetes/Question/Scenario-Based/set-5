10 Tough Kubernetes Scenarios That Can Catch You Off Guard! 
👨‍💻 Can you troubleshoot these real-world Kubernetes issues? Many engineers struggle with these tricky scenarios—let’s see how you do!
1️⃣ Pods Restarting, But No Errors in Logs?
Your pods keep restarting, but liveness & readiness probes pass. CPU & memory look fine. What’s your next step?
💡 Hint: Check kubectl describe node for hidden OOMKills at the node level.
2️⃣ Service is Running, But Can’t Be Accessed Externally?
Your Kubernetes service is deployed, but external users can’t access it. What could be wrong?
💡 Hint: Is your service ClusterIP instead of LoadBalancer or NodePort? Check kubectl get svc.
3️⃣ Why is My Pod Stuck in Terminating?
You deleted a pod, but it’s been stuck in "Terminating" for 30+ minutes. How do you fix it?
💡 Hint: Check for finalizers with kubectl get pod -o yaml or use kubectl delete pod --force --grace-period=0.
4️⃣ Kubernetes Deployment Rollback Fails – What Now?
You tried rolling back a bad deployment, but it fails to revert to the previous state. Why?
💡 Hint: If kubectl rollout undo doesn’t work, check if the previous ReplicaSet was scaled to 0 or deleted.
5️⃣ One Node is Unreachable – But Only Some Pods Fail?
A Kubernetes node becomes unreachable, yet not all pods fail. Why?
💡 Hint: Check if the affected pods have node affinity, anti-affinity, or pod disruption budgets (PDBs) in place.
6️⃣ Why is My Kubernetes Job Stuck in Active State?
You ran a Kubernetes Job, but it’s stuck in an Active state forever. What’s wrong?
💡 Hint: Look at backoffLimit – Jobs with repeated failures can keep retrying indefinitely.
7️⃣ Ingress Not Routing Traffic to Pods?
Your Ingress is configured, but requests never reach your pods. What could be the issue?
💡 Hint: Is the Ingress Controller deployed? Also, check for missing host rules or path mismatches.
8️⃣ Kubernetes Autoscaler Doesn’t Scale Up?
You set up HPA (Horizontal Pod Autoscaler), but your pods aren’t scaling under high traffic. Why?
💡 Hint: Check if the target metrics (CPU/Memory) are correctly defined and if limits are too restrictive.
9️⃣ Kubernetes Persistent Volume Not Mounting?
Your pod is stuck in ContainerCreating because the Persistent Volume isn’t attaching. What’s wrong?
💡 Hint: Check if the PV and PVC match the correct StorageClass and access mode.
🔟 Why Did My Pod Disappear Without Logs?
A pod was running fine but suddenly disappeared—no logs, no errors. What happened?
💡 Hint: Check if it was Evicted due to node pressure or if a cronjob/controller deleted it automatically.
