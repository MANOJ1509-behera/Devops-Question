3. You need to monitor application performance and resource usage in your cluster.Which tools would you use to monitor Kubernetes clusters effectively?
How would you implement monitoring for resource usage, application logs, and network traffic?

4. A critical application is deployed on your Kubernetes cluster, and you are required to implement disaster recovery. How would you design a backup and recovery solution for the application and cluster?
What tools or strategies would you use to back up etcd, persistent data, and application configurations?

5.You need to perform maintenance on a node in your cluster, but it runs critical application pods. How would you drain the node without causing downtime for the applications? What would you do if some pods fail to evict during the drain?

6. You have applications running in two separate Kubernetes clusters, and they need to communicate securely. How would you establish secure communication between applications across clusters? What tools or practices would you use for cross-cluster networking?

7. Your team demands zero downtime during deployments.
How would you configure your deployment strategy to achieve zero downtime?
Compare and contrast the use of RollingUpdate and Blue/Green Deployments.

8. You need to expose an application securely over HTTPS using an ingress controller.How would you configure an ingress resource with SSL termination?
What considerations would you make for managing SSL certificates in Kubernetes?

9. You have been asked to review the security posture of your Kubernetes cluster.What steps would you take to harden the cluster?
How would you ensure RBAC policies, network policies, and secure communication between components are implemented?

1. tell me something about your self 
2. what is kubernetes? Explain its Architecture 
3. what do you understand by loadbalancer in terms of kubernetes 
4. what do you understand by namespace in kubernetes?

8. Tell me a process how to migrate database on eks cluster 
9. can you explain me the deployment process of docarized app that is stored in git repo 
10. there is a docker container now this docker container have sonarqube installed init and the the application is up and running everything is going fine.I restarted my docker container now the sonarqube is coming up but not sharing any data what went wrong over here 
11. how do you integrate EBS volume if we have an pod 
12. Your application increase traffic during peak how to set up autoscaling to recase cluster worker node

```
âœ… 1) What happens if your Kubernetes resource definition is accidentally deleted?
ðŸ‘‰Answer: Kubernetes loses track of the resource. On next deployment, it attempts to recreate everything, causing duplicates or failures. Recovery may require manual intervention or restoring from backups. Always use GitOps for version control.

âœ… 2) How do you handle large-scale refactoring without downtime?
ðŸ‘‰Answer: Use rolling updates and canary deployments to minimize impact. Split changes into smaller PRs and verify configurations carefully to prevent service disruption.

âœ… 3) What happens if a pod fails halfway through an update?
ðŸ‘‰Answer: Kubernetes maintains the desired state. Failed pods are marked as unhealthy, and the system will attempt to restart them. Use readiness probes to ensure only healthy pods receive traffic.

âœ… 4) How do you manage secrets in Kubernetes?
ðŸ‘‰Answer: Use Kubernetes Secrets or integrate with external secret management systems (like HashiCorp Vault). Ensure secrets are encrypted at rest and in transit, and follow best practices for RBAC.

âœ… 5) What happens if kubectl apply shows no changes but the cluster was modified outside Kubernetes?
ðŸ‘‰Answer: Kubernetes remains unaware until a reconciliation occurs. Regularly implement drift detection to catch unauthorized changes.

âœ… 6) What happens if you delete a resource definition from your configuration?
ðŸ‘‰Answer: Kubernetes destroys the corresponding resources. Use "kubectl delete" cautiously or apply resource protection annotations for critical components.

âœ… 7) What happens if a Kubernetes API version changes between releases?
ðŸ‘‰Answer: Compatibility issues may arise. Always read release notes, use version constraints, and test upgrades in non-production environments to identify breaking changes.

âœ… 8) How do you implement zero-downtime updates in Kubernetes?
ðŸ‘‰Answer: Leverage rolling updates, blue-green deployments, and health checks to ensure smooth transitions. For databases, consider using StatefulSets with proper failover strategies.

âœ… 9) What happens if you have circular dependencies in your Kubernetes manifests?
ðŸ‘‰Answer: Kubernetes will encounter deployment issues. Refactor configurations to establish clear dependencies, possibly using Helm charts to manage complex relationships.

âœ… 10) What happens if you rename a resource in your Kubernetes configuration?
ðŸ‘‰Answer: Kubernetes treats this as a deletion and recreation. Use annotations or update strategies to manage changes while preserving the resource state and minimizing downtime.
