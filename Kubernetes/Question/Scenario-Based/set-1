1. A pod is unable to get scheduled despite sufficient resources available in the cluster.What steps would you take to diagnose why the pod isnâ€™t being scheduled? How do you analyze taints ,tolerations, affinity and node selector to resolve such issues?

2. A pod in your cluster is stuck in the Pending state for a long time.What are the possible reasons for a pod being in a Pending state?How will you diagnose and resolve this issue?

3. You are tasked with managing resource utilization in your cluster. A namespace is consuming more CPU and memory than expected. How would you enforce resource limits and quotas on the namespace to control resource usage?How do requests and limits impact resource scheduling and cluster stability?

4. You have a microservice-based application deployed in Kubernetes. The traffic to the application spikes unpredictably during peak hours. How would you configure the cluster to scale the application automatically?What are the differences between Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) and Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA), and when would you use each?

5. You perform a deployment update to roll out a new version of an application, but users immediately start reporting downtime and errors.What steps would you take to debug and roll back the failed deployment?How can you make your deployments more robust to avoid such issues in the future?

6. Your applicationâ€™s pods are unable to communicate with each other across namespaces, and some services are unreachable.What steps would you take to debug the networking issue?How do you verify DNS resolution, network policies, and service configurations in Kubernetes?

7. One of your nodes is experiencing high CPU usage, and some pods are getting evicted. How do you identify which pods are consuming excessive resources and why they are being evicted?What are some strategies to prevent resource contention in your Kubernetes cluster?

8. A team reports that their pods using Persistent Volumes(PVs) are unable to mount storage. How do you troubleshoot and resolve issues related to persistent storage not being mounted?What are some best practices for handling persistent storage in Kubernetes?

```
1. In a cluster with two nodes, one with pods and the other without, which node will a new pod be scheduled to?

2. If an application running in a container encounters an OOM (Out-of-Memory) error, will the container restart, or will the entire Pod be recreated?

3. Can application configurations such as environment variables or ConfigMap updates be applied dynamically without recreating the Pod?

4. Is a Pod stable once created, even if the user takes no further action?

5. Can a Service of type ClusterIP ensure load balancing for TCP traffic?

6. How should application logs be collected, and is there a risk of losing logs?

7. If an HTTP Server Podâ€™s livenessProbe is functioning correctly, does it mean the application is problem-free?

8. How can an application scale to handle traffic fluctuations?

9. When you execute kubectl exec -it <pod> -- bash, are you logging into the pod?

10. How would you troubleshoot if a container in a Pod repeatedly exits and restarts?

ðŸ‘‰ 1. If you have a Pod with initContainers that fail, but the main container has restartPolicy: Never, what happens to the Pod status?

ðŸ‘‰ 2. When using a StatefulSet with 3 replicas and you delete replica-1, will replica-2 and replica-3 be renamed to maintain sequential ordering?

ðŸ‘‰ 3. Can a DaemonSet Pod be scheduled on a master node that has NoSchedule taint without explicitly adding tolerations?

ðŸ‘‰ 4. If you update a Deployment's image while a rolling update is in progress, will K8s wait for the current rollout to complete or start a new one immediately?

ðŸ‘‰ 5. When a node becomes NotReady, how long does it take for Pods to be evicted, and can this be controlled per Pod?

ðŸ‘‰ 6. Is it possible for a Pod to have multiple containers sharing the same port on localhost, and what happens if they try to bind simultaneously?

ðŸ‘‰ 7. If you create a PVC with ReadWriteOnce access mode, can multiple Pods on the same node access it simultaneously?

ðŸ‘‰ 8. When using Horizontal Pod Autoscaler with custom metrics, what happens if the metrics server becomes unavailable during high load?

ðŸ‘‰ 9. Can you run kubectl port-forward to a Pod that's in CrashLoopBackOff state, and will it work?

ðŸ‘‰ 10. If a ServiceAccount is deleted while Pods using it are still running, what happens to the mounted tokens and API access?

ðŸ‘‰ 11. When using anti-affinity rules, is it possible to create a "deadlock" where no new Pods can be scheduled?

ðŸ‘‰ 12. If you have a Job with parallelism: 3 and one Pod fails with restartPolicy: Never, will the Job create a replacement Pod?

ðŸ‘‰ 13. Can a Pod's resource requests be modified after creation, and what's the difference between requests and limits during OOM scenarios?

ðŸ‘‰ 14. When using network policies, if you don't specify egress rules, are outbound connections blocked by default?

ðŸ‘‰ 15. If a Persistent Volume gets corrupted, can multiple PVCs bound to it cause cascading failures across different namespaces?
